1.Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart): To identify seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities
2.Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map): To identify regions with significant lending activity and assess regional disparities
3.Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart): To allow the client to understand the distribution of loans across various term lengths.
4.Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart): How lending metrics are distributed among borrowers with different employment lengths, helping us assess the impact of employment history on loan applications.
5.Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart): Will provide a visual breakdown of loan metrics based on the stated purposes of loans, aiding in the understanding of the primary reasons borrowers seek financing.
6.Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map): For a hierarchical view of how home ownership impacts loan applications and disbursements.
